# OpenClimateModel
Tools for predicting the quality-of-life and environmental impact for various carbon mitigation programs

In response to Elon Musk's challenge for carbon capture technology, this non-profit open source project will allow for customizable datasets and models, open for continuous peer-review to calculate the cost-benefit of various carbon-capture techniques. Many factors are considered, like Quality-Of-Life across 300+ global economic sub-regions, Net Carbon Footprint, Total Burden per Income Group. Various models for CO2-Temperature, including newer variables, like solar radiance and natural contributions, like volcanic activity, or whatever else the model requires. Various languages can be used, including Java, C# and C++.
